Projects from the JetBrains Academy on hyperskill


This repo will contain some projects that I have worked on through the hyperskill 'Python Developer'
path. These projects were finished and uploaded here, while they are not perfect they still get the
job done. I do plan on coming back after finishing the track and cleaning them up, making them more
efficient, etc.

Some of these projects may repeat some concepts that I have already posted on my GitHub but they 
serve as a good refresher in those cases
